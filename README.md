ACTIVITY HUB

- Inspiration
  
My inspiration for this project stemmed from my experiences with my CCA, Stageoworks. Over the months of involvement, I observed a significant challenge: information was dispersed across various platforms. For instance, reminders were communicated through WhatsApp, while schedules were maintained on Google Sheets, among other scattered locations. This fragmentation proved to be a considerable inconvenience, requiring members to navigate multiple sources to access necessary information and locate relevant links. Additionally, WhatsApp reminders were frequently overlooked or lost amidst a deluge of messages, leading to missed notifications and a general sense of disorganization.

Recognizing these issues, I conceived the idea of developing a centralized web portal designed to consolidate all essential resources and communications for CCA members. By integrating announcements, schedules, and other crucial information into a single, accessible platform, the portal aims to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and ensure that no critical updates are overlooked. This solution not only addresses the current inefficiencies but also enhances overall coordination within the CCA, ultimately fostering a more organized and productive environment.

Furthermore, incorporating an admin page into the web portal significantly enhances its functionality and user experience. This dedicated administrative interface will allow both teachers and CCA EXCO leaders to manage and update all relevant content from a single, unified location. The ability to make real-time changes to schedules, reminders, and other critical information without the need to navigate multiple platforms streamlines the management process and reduces the risk of errors or outdated information.

The admin page also facilitates more efficient control over access and permissions. By utilizing a system of manageable and shareable passwords, administrators can easily grant or restrict access as needed. This centralized control ensures that only authorized individuals can make alterations, thereby maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the information. This approach not only simplifies the process of updating and sharing information but also enhances security and accountability, making it easier to coordinate and oversee the various aspects of the CCA's activities.

Additionally, I was motivated by a desire to build a more connected and supportive community within my CCA. I envisioned a platform where members could share encouraging and motivating messages with each other. By including this feature, I aimed to boost morale and enhance team spirit. 

In summary, I undertook this project to improve organization and communication within ASRJC and Stageworks, aiming to streamline information management, uplift CCA morale and enhance overall efficiency, to make a positive impact on the ASRJC community!

- Challenges encountered
  
Since I was pretty new to Flask and many of the technologies involved, I ran into several challenges while building the Activity Hub web app.

Hereâ€™s a rundown of what I encountered and how I tackled each issue!

Getting the Hang of Flask:

Challenge: I had never worked with Flask before, so setting up routes, handling requests, and rendering templates was all new to me. It felt a bit like trying to read a foreign language at first.
Solution: I practised for a long time and tried my upmost best to debug all my problems. The CS50 duck was rlly useful! There were many times where my webapp was not showing up properly. This was usually due to small  typo errors or wrong variable names. Even though these errors were minor, i had realised what a serious impact it could have on my webapp. I strived to be more careful and look clearly when i type.

Working with SQLite:
Challenge: I had no prior experience with databases or SQL, so creating tables, writing queries, and managing data was a bit confusing.
Solution: I was completely lost with SQL at first. It seemed far fetched for me to actually successfully use the SQL datebase. I comtemplated just sticking to my comfort zone like txt and csv files. However, diving deeper into the benifits of using an SQL database, i had realised that more pain equates to more gain. I had watched Youtube tutorials and also asked my helpful friends who were more knowledgable in SQL. Using SQL really improved the effeciency of of my information accessing and storing, definately integrating the data more seemlessly into my webapp.

Implementing Password Hashing with bcrypt:
Challenge: Password hashing was a completely new concept for me, and I wasnâ€™t sure how to securely handle user passwords.
Solution: I checked out the bcrypt documentation and followed tutorials to learn how to hash and verify passwords. I practiced with basic examples to see how it all fit together.

Setting Up Token-Based Authentication:
Challenge:I wanted to make sure that only users that type in the correct password was allowed access to the site. However, I was unfamiliar with how token-based authentication worked, especially how to generate and manage tokens securely.
Solution: I looked up resources on tokens and JSON Web Tokens and used Pythonâ€™s uuid library to generate tokens. I tested how to validate and manage these tokens within Flask.

Managing Dynamic Content:
Challenge: Handling dynamic content like announcements and attendance records was tricky, especially with updating and querying the database.
Solution: I learned how to handle form data and database interactions through Flaskâ€™s documentation. I created test cases to make sure that the data was being handled correctly. I also made sure that i had the correct format for my data, like using columns for my attendance dates and making sure column names were not similiar as it would cause it to crash.

Making It Visually appealing and user-friendly:
Challenge: With just basic HTML and CSS skills, making sure the app looked good and was easy to navigate was daunting
Solution: I used responsive design techniques. I had experimented with different input types as well as the styling options for each of them. I also planned a colour scheme and tried my best to stick to it. By making the insturctions and navigation pop, i ensured that the user experience would be an memorable one, and also prevent any errors.

Debugging and Testing:
Challenge: Debugging the app and making sure everything worked correctly was tough, especially since I was still learning.
Solution: I used Flaskâ€™s debugging tools and set the app to run in debug mode. Testing thoroughly and using browser developer tools helped me spot and fix issues.

Some key issues were:
1. Making sure that the list from the checkbox was equal to the id of the row i wanted to delete or add. I had to do alot of debugging and experimenting with values.
2. Making sure the token was usable and that the admin page was not accessible by users who just change the link of the page.
3. My rows were not showing up properly. The data was either wrong or at the wrong place. I had to edit my SQL queries and troubleshooted until the result was accurate.
4. For the attendance, column names had could not repeat and had a specific format. They did not allow "-" which was the format in the input type date. I had to debug this issues and change the format according and also revert it back when displaying it on the site.
   
- Accomplishments that I'm proud of

As someone new to web development, Iâ€™m really proud of pulling off a web app that Iâ€™m actually happy with. It wasnâ€™t a walk in the parkâ€”creating this took a ton of time, late nights, hard work, and effort. There were definitely moments when I was tempted to give up and implement something less demanding. But I stuck with it and kept pushing through, even when it felt like I was hitting a wall.
I kept going and didnâ€™t let myself back down, consulting my friends and the CS50 duck. Seeing the finished app made all that hard work feel worth it. I felt a huge sense of accomplishment, something Iâ€™ve never felt before. It was amazing to see that my efforts paid off and that I managed to step out of my comfort zone to achieve something meaningful. This experience not only enhanced my skills but also boosted my confidence in tackling unfamiliar projects.
  
- What I learned

Resilience: Sticking with the project through tough times taught me to keep going even when things got difficult.

Patience: I learned that good things take time and that itâ€™s important to take things one step at a time.

Confidence: Completing the project boosted my self-esteem and showed me that I can learn new things and succeed.

Problem-Solving: Overcoming obstacles improved my ability to figure things out and trust my instincts.

Satisfaction of Achievement: Seeing the project come together gave me a deep sense of pride and accomplishment.

Enjoying the Journey: Despite the challenges, I learned to appreciate the process and find joy in reaching my goals.

- What's next forÂ Activity Hub!

Even though Activity Hub now enables centralised information viewing, there are still lots of features that could be added.
For instance, for stageworks there could be
1. Script storing
2. Blocking generator
3. Member profiles
4. Skill practising
5. Set manager
6. Set planner
7. Prop tracker

In the future, if this project goes any further i would like to implement these for Stageoworks!
For these features i hope to gather opinions from teachers and CCA mates on their preference and adjust it to their liking:)
For now, Acitivity Hub is pretty usable for all CCAs which i think is a plus in terms of flexibility:)
